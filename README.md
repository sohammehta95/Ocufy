# Abstract
Eye-testing is one of the most important health check-up required by all individuals. However, it turns out that it is also one of the most neglected check-ups of all time. Most people do not anticipate the need for checking their eyes until their vision is affected. Due to these reasons, we created Ocufy - a mobile eye testing interface with which any user can check their eye acuity in just under five minutes. Not only is it free to use for everyone, but it also provides one of the most accurate results of a mobile eye test. This accuracy is achieved with the help of an algorithm which finds the user’s screen-to-face distance and starts the test only after a minimum threshold is achieved thus providing the most authentic results. We performed the evaluation with 10 people and found out that the application provided accurate results 85% of the time. Moreover, the application received an average rating of 4.4/5 with over 80% respondents recommending it to use it next time to check their eyes.

# Intorduction
Today, with advances in technology, the human eye is getting more and more hitched to the digital screen making it prone to blurred vision. A study published in the journal Ophthalmology found that on current trends, 50 percent of people on the planet would need glasses or contact lenses with 10 percent suffering from severe myopia [1]. Our application relieves the pain of the user who has no access to an eye clinic. Also, it is for the user who does not anticipate the need for checking their eye until their vision is affected.
